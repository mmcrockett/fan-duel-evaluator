  "news":{"items":[{"date":"<b>June 20th<\/b> 6:45pm EDT","summary":"Scherzer threw his first career no-hitter Saturday against the Pirates, striking out 10 without issuing a walk.","details":"The 30-year-old was one out away from a perfect game but he hit Jose Tabata on the elbow, though Tabata did appear to lean into it. Scherzer got the next batter, Josh Harrison, to fly out to left to complete the no-hitter, the second no-no in Major League Baseball this season. It marked Scherzer's second straight complete game but just the third of his career. He's allowed three baserunners in his last two outings (57 batters faced)."},{"date":"<b>June 18th<\/b> 9:47am EDT","summary":"Scherzer will have his next start pushed back a day to Saturday against the Pirates, the Washington Post reports.","details":"Doug Fister is rejoining the rotation on Thursday, but the Nats elected to keep rookie Joe Ross in the rotation for at least one more start, bumping everyone else forward a day. Scherzer is coming off a one-hit, 16-K shutout of the Brewers, and will look to continue a stellar first season in Washington."},{"date":"<b>June 14th<\/b> 8:29pm EDT","summary":"Scherzer was lights out Sunday against the Brewers, tossing a complete game shutout and striking out 16 batters en route to his seventh win of the season.","details":"Carlos Gomez led off the seventh inning with a single to break up Scherzer's bid for a no-hitter, and other than an eighth-inning walk, he was nearly flawless on the day. The Nats' ace lowered his season ERA to 1.93 with this outing and will next face the Pirates at home Friday."},{"date":"<b>June 09th<\/b> 10:16pm EDT","summary":"Scherzer took the loss Tuesday, allowing four runs in 6.2 innings against the Yankees.","details":"Scherzer has now had consecutive mediocre starts in a row. In his last two outings the ace has allowed eight earned runs combined. The righty is a strong bet to rebound in his next start, coming this weekend against the Brewers."},{"date":"<b>June 02nd<\/b> 11:14pm EDT","summary":"Scherzer (6-4) allowed four runs on six hits and two walks over six innings in Tuesday's loss to Toronto.","details":"Overall, Scherzer pitched better than the box score would suggest. Two swings of Kevin Pillar's bat accounted for all four runs off Scherzer, and Toronto batters combined for only three hits off the righty. Still, his ERA rose to 1.85 as he suffered his fourth loss of the season. Scherzer will look to get back on track at home Sunday versus the Cubs."},{"date":"<b>May 28th<\/b> 12:59am EDT","summary":"Scherzer dominated the Cubs on Wednesday, striking out 13 batters over seven scoreless innings and picking up his sixth win of the season in the process. He allowed five hits and walked just one batter in the game.","details":"Cubs hitters stood almost no chance Wednesday, but that was the case with most hitters who faced Scherzer in May. In 43 innings over six starts during the month, Scherzer posted a 1.67 ERA, struck out 56 batters, and allowed just 39 batters to reach base via the hit or walk. He did raise his ERA from 1.26 at the end of April to 1.51 at the end of May, but it's hard to quibble with that."},{"date":"<b>May 22nd<\/b> 10:53pm EDT","summary":"Scherzer was on his game again Friday night, allowing one run on four hits, walking one and striking out six over eight innings of a 2-1 win against The Phillies.","details":"He nudged his ERA down to 1.67 while notching his fifth win on the season. Scherzer tossed 110 pitches (79 for strikes) in out-dueling Phillies' starter Sean O'Sullivan, and like most of the Nationals' team, he is in a groove right now."},{"date":"<b>May 17th<\/b> 2:41am EDT","summary":"Scherzer pitched another gem Saturday, going seven scoreless innings while striking out 11 in the 4-1 win over San Diego on Saturday.","details":"Scherzer has been in Cy Young form this season and this game lowers his ERA to an impressive 1.75. Scherzer is just 4-3, but has a fantastic matchup in his next start when he hosts Philadelphia next Saturday."},{"date":"<b>May 12th<\/b> 8:37am EDT","summary":"Scherzer rebounded after a rough start, going seven innings Monday against the Diamondbacks and only allowing one run while striking out six.","details":"On May 6, Scherzer gave up five earned runs and 10 hits to the Marlins, but rebounded nicely Monday. His ERA is down to 1.99 and his WHIP is at 0.93, among the best int he league. His next scheduled start is Saturday against the Padres."},{"date":"<b>May 06th<\/b> 3:54pm EDT","summary":"Scherzer (2-3) had his worst start of the year Wednesday against the Marlins, allowing five runs on 10 hits over seven innings, but he struck out 10 and collected his second win.","details":"Had Nationals manager Matt Williams elected to end Scherzer's day after two runs and seven hits over seven strong innings, he would have finished with yet another quality start. Unfortunately, it didn't work out that way -- Scherzer went out there to start the eighth and made a mess, giving up two singles followed by a Giancarlo Stanton homer. Of course, considering that Scherzer had allowed five earned runs -- total -- in his first five starts of the season, we're willing to cut him plenty of slack. He'll next face the Diamondbacks on Tuesday."}]}}
